# Sanity check

We are recording, aren't we?

## Review

What are `UFunction`s and `UProperty`s?

Macros which mark functions / data for Unreal to care about -
this makes them usable in the editor / Blueprints, or adds other benefits like
network replication
<!-- .element class="fragment" -->

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

## Review

UE4 has 4 types of strings. What's their purpose?


| Method     | Explanation |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| `TCHAR*` | Properly-encoded, null-terminated string <!-- .element class="fragment" --> |
| `FString` | A mutable, standard string class  <!-- .element class="fragment" --> |
| `FText`     | Localized, immutable string, used for output <!-- .element class="fragment" --> |
| `FName` | Interned, immutable string, used for identification <!-- .element class="fragment" --> |

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

## Review

What do these 2 do?

```cpp
DECLARE_DELEGATE_TwoParams(FOnNewAssetRequested,
    const FString&,
    TWeakObjectPtr<UClass>);
DECLARE_MULTICAST_DELEGATE(FOnCompilerNotFound);
```

* `FOnNewAssetRequested` is a single cast delegate matching `void Foo(const FString&, TWeakObjectPtr<UClass>)`

<!-- .element class="fragment" -->

* `FOnCompilerNotFound` is a multicast cast delegate matching `void Foo()`

<!-- .element class="fragment" -->

## Architecture in UE4

1. UObjects, UClasses, UStructs
2. Actors and Components
3. Make a simple live game

--- NEXT SLIDE ---

## UObject

The base class for (almost) everything, provides:

* Automatic memory management (via Garbage collection)
* Automatic serialization / editor integration (via reflection)
* Useful common methods

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

## UObject important functions

| Method     | Explanation |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| `T* NewObject( UObject* Outer, UClass* Class, ...)` | Creates a new `UObject` |
| `bool IsValid(UObject*)` | Whether the object can be used (not null and not scheduled for deletion) |
| `UClass* StaticClass()` | Gets a descriptor of the class |

--- NEXT SLIDE ---

## UClass

```cpp
UCLASS([specifier, ...], [meta(key=value, ...)])
class ClassName : public ParentName
{
    GENERATED_BODY()
}
```

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

## UClasses header

At the top of each gameplay class header file, the generated header file (created automatically) needs to be included

```cpp
#include "ClassName.generated.h"
```

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

## UClass Specifiers

* `Abstract` - Prevents the user from adding Actors of this class to Levels
* `Blueprintable` - Exposes this class as an acceptable base class for creating Blueprints
* `Deprecated` - This class is deprecated and should not be used anymore

--- NEXT SLIDE ---

## UStructs

* C++ structs with support for member (but not method) reflection
* More lightweight than UClass

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

## UStructs declaration

```cpp
USTRUCT([Specifier, Specifier, ...])
struct StructName
{
    GENERATED_BODY()
};
```

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

## Struct Specifiers

* `Atomic` - always be serialized as a single unit
* `BlueprintType` - can be used for variables in Blueprints

--- NEXT SLIDE ---

## Game object model

the set of programming primitives
used to represent any object in the world.

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

## UE4 game object model

* UE4 is a mixture between OOP and component orientated design
  - Gameplay is component-based
  - OOP is widely used for creating reusable templates

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

```cpp
UCLASS(config=Game)
class ASusiCharacter : public ACharacter
{
    GENERATED_BODY()
    /** Camera boom positioning the camera behind the character */
    UPROPERTY(VisibleAnywhere, BlueprintReadOnly)
    USpringArmComponent* CameraBoom;

    /** Follow camera */
    UPROPERTY(VisibleAnywhere, BlueprintReadOnly)
    UCameraComponent* FollowCamera;

    UPROPERTY(VisibleAnywhere, BlueprintReadOnly)
    USusiComponent* SusiConnection;
}
```

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

```cpp
UCLASS(BlueprintType)
class SUSI_API USusiComponent : public UActorComponent
{
    virtual void BeginPlay() override;
    virtual void TickComponent(float DeltaTime, ...) override;
    /// Requests the user data to be reloaded from susi.
    UFUNCTION(BlueprintCallable, Category="Susi")
    void RequestDataReload();

    /// The data loaded for the student.
    UPROPERTY(BlueprintReadOnly)
    FStudentInfo LoadedStudentInfo;

    DECLARE_DYNAMIC_MULTICAST_DELEGATE(FInfoLoadedDelegate);
    /// Notifies the client when the data for the user has been loaded.
    UPROPERTY(BlueprintAssignable)
    FInfoLoadedDelegate OnInfoLoaded;
}
```

## UE4 Gameplay subsystem

- Worlds, full of
  - Actors, full of
    - Components, Classes, Structs, full of
      - Properties and Functions
  - Some UObjects are NOT Actors

* Can be accessed through code, Blueprints, the editor.
* There is more than one world while you are using the Editor.

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

* Everything that is in the world is an actor
* Each actor has different components
* Components can be
  - `Tick`-ed every frame
  - Notified when certain events occurs on the owner object

--- NEXT SLIDE ---

## Actors

* Can be placed into a level
* Support 3D transformations
* Contain Root component
* Can contain components

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

## Actor Spawning

```cpp
AActor* UWorld::SpawnActor
(
    UClass*         Class,
    FName           InName,
    FVector const*  Location,
    FRotator const* Rotation,
    ...
)
```

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

## Actor Lifecycle

* Actor is spawned
* `PostInitializeComponents` - Called after the Actor's components have been initialized
* `BeginPlay` - Game started
* `BeginDestroy` - free up memory and begin releasing other resources
* `FinishDestroy` - object is really going to be destroyed

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

## Unreal and Actors

* Unreal may create instances of your Actors whenever it likes!
* Never do complicated things in the constructor / destructor
  * Use `PostInitializeComponent` / `BeginDestroy`
* Neither rely on that there will be only a single instance

--- NEXT SLIDE ---

## Components

* Special type of Object that Actors can attach to themselves as sub-objects
* Useful for sharing common behaviors
* Have a bunch of virtual functions you can override!

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

## 3 Types of Components

* `UActorComponent` - abstract behaviors and non-physical concepts
* `USceneComponent` - has a position / rotation
* `UPrimitiveComponent` - has some geometry (can be rendered / collided)

--- NEXT SLIDE ---

## Game Mode

* Governs the rules of the game
* Only the server has an instance (for cheat prevention)
* Spawn gameplay relevant Actors there

--- VERTICAL SLIDE ---

## Game State

* Keeps the state of the game (Score, Teams, etc.)
* Every player has a copy
* You need to synchronize it in Multiplayer Games

--- NEXT SLIDE ---

## Live Demo Time

Let's play Robo Cube!

Few simple rules:

- on begin play - find player
- start moving towards player
- when near player, explode

Questions?
